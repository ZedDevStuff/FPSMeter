# FPSMeter

FPSMeter is an Ultrakill mod that adds a FPS counter. When installed, just press F3 anywhere in the game.

# Installation

Put the downloaded .dll file into you BepInEx plugins folder or "UKMM Mods" if you use UKMM. Requires [UKUIHelper](https://github.com/ZedDevStuff/UKUIHelper) to work. As with UKUIHelper, this has a high chance to work on other Unity games but i didn't test it.
